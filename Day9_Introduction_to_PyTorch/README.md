# Day 9: Introduction to PyTorch

## Objective
Learn the fundamentals of PyTorch by building the same neural network from Day 8, but now using PyTorch's powerful built-in features.

## What Was Covered
- PyTorch tensor operations and properties
- Automatic differentiation with autograd
- Building neural networks with `nn.Module`
- Training with built-in loss functions and optimizers
- Comparison between scratch and PyTorch implementations

## Key PyTorch Concepts Learned
1. **Tensors**: The fundamental data structure in PyTorch
2. **Autograd**: Automatic gradient computation
3. **nn.Module**: Base class for all neural network modules
4. **Optimizers**: SGD, Adam, RMSprop for training
5. **Loss Functions**: Built-in loss functions like MSELoss

## Files Created
- `pytorch_fundamentals.py`: PyTorch basics and tensor operations
- `pytorch_neural_network.py`: Neural network implementation in PyTorch
- `comparison_analysis.md`: Scratch vs PyTorch comparison
- `pytorch_practice.py`: Additional exercises with different architectures and optimizers
- `pytorch_training_loss.png`: Training loss visualization

## Technical Details
- **Network Architecture**: 2-4-1 (same as Day 8 for comparison)
- **Activation Function**: Sigmoid
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- **Dataset**: XOR problem (for direct comparison)

## How to Run
```bash
# Learn PyTorch fundamentals
python pytorch_fundamentals.py

# Build and train neural network
python pytorch_neural_network.py

# Practice additional concepts
python pytorch_practice.py
```

## Results
The PyTorch implementation achieved similar results to the scratch implementation:
- Final loss: < 0.01
- Accurate XOR predictions
- Clean, maintainable code

## Key Advantages of PyTorch
- **Automatic differentiation**: No manual gradient calculations
- **Built-in layers**: Pre-implemented network components
- **GPU support**: Easy acceleration
- **Professional features**: Ready for production and research

## Insights Gained
- PyTorch abstracts away complex mathematics
- Focus shifts from implementation to architecture
- Development is much faster and less error-prone
- Professional frameworks enable complex projects

## Next Steps
- Day 10: Building more complex neural networks with PyTorch
- Day 11: Working with real datasets and data loaders
- Day 12: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
