## 30 Days of AI Engineering & Data Science

This repository documents my 30-day intensive journey to master and polish my skills in AI Engineering (focused on GenAI/LLMs) and Data Science.

## Goals
- Solidify Core Data Science skills (Data Wrangling, Visualization, Classic ML).
- Master Deep Learning fundamentals with PyTorch.
- Build and deploy practical Generative AI projects (RAG, Fine-Tuning).
- Establish a strong MLOps foundation.
